# data-ghost-api

FastAPI-based backend service for the Data Ghost portfolio project.

## Development Workflow

**CRITICAL: Always run tests after making code changes.**

Currently, no tests exist for this project. Tests need to be created before implementing new features.

### Workflow Rules

1. Run tests after every code change
2. Do not commit code with failing tests
3. All git pushes must be done manually (Claude cannot push to remote)
